                <div class="subcontainer">
                    <h2>Robert's Rules of Order (RRO) are a set of rules and proecdures that ensure 
                        equal opportunity for members of a meeting to speak up and participate.
                        While there are many different variations of RRO, most variations share
                        some common core principles 
                        <br>
                        (Taken from the University of Louisiana Monroe):
                       
                    </h2>
                </div>
                <div class="infoContainer">
                    <div class="scrollText"><p><h2>Motion</h2> To introduce a new piece of business or propose a decision or action, a motion must be
                        made by a group member ("I move that......") A second motion must then also be made (raise your
                        hand and say, "I second it.") After limited discussion the group then votes on the motion. A
                        majority vote is required for the motion to pass (or quorum as specified in your bylaws.)
                        </p></div>
                    <div class="scrollText"><p> <h2>Postpone Indefinitely:</h2> This tactic is used to kill a motion. When passed, the motion cannot be
                        reintroduced at that meeting. It may be brought up again at a later date. This is made as a motion ("I
                        move to postpone indefinitely..."). A second is required. A majority vote is required to postpone the
                        motion under consideration.
                        </p></div>
                    <div class="scrollText"><p> <h2>Amend</h2> This is the process used to change a motion under consideration. Perhaps you like the idea
                        proposed but not exactly as offered. Raise your hand and make the following motion: "I move to
                        amend the motion on the floor." This also requires a second. After the motion to amend is seconded,
                        a majority vote is needed to decide whether the amendment is accepted. Then a vote is taken on the
                        amended motion. In some organizations, a "friendly amendment" is made. If the person who made
                        the original motion agrees with the suggested changes, the amended motion may be voted on without
                        a separate vote to approve the amendment.</p></div>
                    <div class="scrollText"><p> <h2>Commit</h2> This is used to place a motion in committee. It requires a second. A majority vote must
                        rule to carry it. At the next meeting the committee is required to prepare a report on the motion
                        committed. If an appropriate committee exists, the motion goes to that committee. If not, a new
                        committee is established.</p></div>
                    <div class="scrollText"><p> <h2>Question</h2> To end a debate immediately, the question is called (say "I call the question") and needs a
                        second. A vote is held immediately (no further discussion is allowed). A two-thirds vote is required
                        for passage. If it is passed, the motion on the floor is voted on immediately.
                        </p></div>
                    <div class="scrollText"><p> <h2>Table</h2> To table a discussion is to lay aside the business at hand in such a manner that it will be
                        considered later in the meeting or at another time ("I make a motion to table this discussion until the
                        next meeting. In the meantime, we will get more information so we can better discuss the issue.") A
                        second is needed and a majority vote required to table the item being discussed</p></div>
                    <div class="scrollText"><p> <h2>Adjourn</h2> A motion is made to end the meeting. A second motion is required. A majority vote is
                        then required for the meeting to be adjourned (ended).</p></div>
